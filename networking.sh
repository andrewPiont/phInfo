# File: networking.sh
#  Installs networking requirements 
#    Assumes one ethernet port (to be used for ethernet
#    connectivity to the Internet if available) and built
#    in wifi or a usb wifi dongle which is to be used as
#    an access point. This is the situation in the case
#    of the Raspberry Pi but would most likely be different
#    for other hardware.
          
#  Depends on the presence of the following files:
#    dnsmasq.conf
#    hostapd.conf
#    hostapd.conf.wpa  (still a work in progress)
#    interfaces.dhcp
#    interfaces.static

# BEFORE RUNNING THIS SCRIPT:
#
#  1a: Have a look at hostapd.conf and modify accordingly, ESPECIALLY
#  if you plan to have two or more servers operating within range
#  of each other.  This applies to the SSID and channel (6, 1, 11)
#  you plan to use.  You'll want to avoid conflicts.

#  1b: The file hostapd.conf.wpa is still a work in progress:
#  I've been unsuccessful getting protected wifi working on the
#  Raspberry Pi.
# https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-wireless-access-point/

#  2: interfaces.static is provided if you want the eth0
#  interface to have a static address.  If so,  you'll
#  a: probably want to edit this file to suit your own network
#  and
#  b: need to comment out the "DHCP" section and 'uncomment'
#  the "STATIC" section below.

# This script is written so as to be idempotent.

set -o errexit  # ends if an error is returned.
set -o pipefail # pipe failure causes an error.
set -o nounset  # ends if an undefined variable is encountered.

# hostapd: pkg allowing use of Wi-Fi as an access point (AP.)
# dnsmasq: pkg providing dhcp and dns services.
# iw: tool for configuring Linux wireless devices.
