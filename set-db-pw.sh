# adjust-db-pasword.sh script (as described in the README.md file.)

## Set up a mysql server:

sudo mysql <<EOF
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS pathagar CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
DROP USER IF EXISTS pathagar;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
CREATE USER "pathagar" IDENTIFIED BY "MYSQL_PASSWORD";
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pathagar.* TO "pathagar";
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF
