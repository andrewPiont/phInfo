# Before sourcing this file:
#  1. If you have elected to change the Access Point's IP address
#  then you should change the 10.10.10.10 IP address in line 31
#  to the same address.  Corresponding changes should have been
#  or will still need to be made in dnsmasq.conf and interfaces
#  (and possibly elsewhere as well.)
#  2. Near the end, you'll see comments pertaining to an entry
#  in the `/etc/fstab` file; specifically `LABEL=Static`. You
#  may want to change the `LABEL` to something other than
#  "Static" to suit your own purposes.

sudo shutdown -r now

## Foot Note:

# As Michael explains, it really comes down to the quoting you're
# using and which shell the command is being evaluated in.

# sudo sh -c "echo $ap_ip  library library.lan rachel rachel.lan >> /etc/hosts"

# I would recommend this one as the "correct" solution. IMHO it's
# the simplest one and avoids `sudo -E`. The `$ap_ip` is evaluated
# in the current shell. You don't need to export the variable
# because the subshells don't need to read the variable and never
# see it. They already have the value within the command. `sh` sees
# the full command with the shell redirection. With sudo, `sh` has
# the proper permissions to follow the redirection and write to
# `/etc/hosts`.
  
# In general I would say `sudo -E` is a poor pattern and should be
# avoided. You can imagine this being problematic:

#   PATH=/tmp/evil/bin:$PATH sudo -E echo foo

# This is why even with `sudo -E`, sudo still blocks certain
#  environment variables (like PATH) based on the security policy.
